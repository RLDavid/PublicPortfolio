# Public Portfolio
A public repository for my technical writing portfolio.

This portfolio includes clips from my previous positions. Each has been scrubbed for security information about the companies for which I wrote.

## Documents

Many of these documents are written in a topic-based approach. They were written to be part of a searchable Knowledge Base. **Map_Workfront** is an unfinished user guide for the Project Management tool **Workfront**. The client requested the deliverables in PDFs. 

### AX - Create and Assign...

This document was created for the Service Desk.

### Interaction Client - Change Workstation...

This document was written for End Users to help lessen the volume of calls to the Service Desk.

### MS Excel - Create a Menu

This document was created for a QA team that used Excel as their primary tool in UAT.

### Map_Workfront...

This PDF was created using DITA with oXygen XML Editor. The project required three guides: one for the End User, one for Project Managers, and one for the QA group.
